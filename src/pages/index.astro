        I am a PhD student, studying theoretical astrophysics. I focus on <b>planet formation</b> and <b>the demographics of exoplanets</b>. I am a <b>data-driven theorist</b>, leveraging information encoded in data to understand the underlying physical mechanisms sculpting the observations. This webpage is under construction!

    desc="Exoplanet demographics appear to shift between different regions of the Milky Way. I explore how the formation environment of planets has differed between stellar populations in the Galaxy, and how that may manifest in the planet distribution."

    title="Sculpting the sub-Saturn Period Distribution via Atmospheric Evaporation"
    img="/eva.png"
    desc="The abundance of intermediate-sized planets drops at small orbital distances. I showed that this can be explained by these planetsâ€™ propensity to lose their puffy atmospheres closer in to their host stars. The theory predicts that such planets become less common around more massive stars, which has since been confirmed!"

    title="Can Disk Migration Explain the Giant Planet Period Distribution?"
    img="/Disk.jpeg"
    desc="Gas giant planet abundance grows rapidly with orbital period. I showed analytically and numerically that this feature can be carved out if giant planets arrive at their final orbital locations via migration through their natal protoplanetary disks. This theory predicts that giant planets exhibit an increasing-outward gradient in mass."
